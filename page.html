<h1><b>Open Tallahassee</b></h1></b>
<h2><b>Bike Ride to the North Florida Fair</b></h2>
<h3>11/14/21, 6pm. We're meeting in front of <a href="http://bicyclehouse.org">Bicycle House (458 FAMU Way)</a>.<br>
    It's a 5mi bike ride on a smooth, flat trail. It's a very beginner-friendly ride. <br>
    Once we get to the fair, feel free to wander off! If you want to bike back together, we'll leave around 9pm.<br>
    Unfortunately, if it rains, the ride won't be rescheduled.</h3>
